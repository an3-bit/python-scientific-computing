üìö VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION (VAR) MODEL DEFINITION:

VAR is a multivariate time series model where:
‚Ä¢ Each variable is modeled as a linear combination of past values of ALL variables
‚Ä¢ Captures interdependencies between multiple time series
‚Ä¢ All variables are treated symmetrically (no distinction between dependent/independent)
‚Ä¢ Particularly powerful for systems with complex feedback relationships

Mathematical Form:
Yt = A‚ÇÅYt‚Çã‚ÇÅ + A‚ÇÇYt‚Çã‚ÇÇ + ... + ApYt‚Çãp + Œµt

Where:
‚Ä¢ Yt = vector of k variables at time t
‚Ä¢ Ai = k√ók coefficient matrices for lag i
‚Ä¢ p = lag order
‚Ä¢ Œµt = vector of error terms

üéØ WHEN IS VAR USED IN FORECASTING?

1. Multivariate Economic Forecasting:
   ‚Ä¢ GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates
   ‚Ä¢ All variables influence each other with lags

2. Financial Market Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ Stock prices, exchange rates, commodity prices
   ‚Ä¢ Cross-market spillover effects

3. Business Applications:
   ‚Ä¢ Sales, advertising spend, pricing, competition
   ‚Ä¢ Understanding marketing mix effectiveness

4. Policy Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ Government spending, tax rates, economic outcomes
   ‚Ä¢ Monetary policy transmission mechanisms

5. Supply Chain Management:
   ‚Ä¢ Inventory, demand, lead times, costs
   ‚Ä¢ Coordinated planning across multiple metrics

üè≠ CASE STUDY: RETAIL COMPANY DEMAND FORECASTING SYSTEM

Background:
A major retail chain uses VAR models to forecast demand across multiple product categories
and coordinate inventory, pricing, and marketing decisions.

Variables in the VAR Model:
1. Electronics Sales (Y‚ÇÅ)
2. Clothing Sales (Y‚ÇÇ) 
3. Home & Garden Sales (Y‚ÇÉ)
4. Marketing Spend (Y‚ÇÑ)
5. Average Product Price Index (Y‚ÇÖ)
6. Consumer Confidence Index (Y‚ÇÜ)

üìã VAR IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

Step 1: Data Collection
‚Ä¢ Monthly data for 5 years (60 observations)
‚Ä¢ Ensure all series have same frequency and time range
‚Ä¢ Handle missing values and outliers

Step 2: Stationarity Testing
‚Ä¢ Test each variable with Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
‚Ä¢ Apply appropriate transformations (differencing, logging)
‚Ä¢ Ensure all variables are stationary

Step 3: Lag Order Selection
‚Ä¢ Use information criteria (AIC, BIC, HQ)
‚Ä¢ Apply sequential testing procedures
‚Ä¢ Balance model complexity vs. forecasting accuracy

Step 4: VAR Model Estimation
‚Ä¢ Estimate coefficient matrices using OLS
‚Ä¢ Each equation estimated separately
‚Ä¢ System approach ensures efficiency

print("""
üß† GRANGER CAUSALITY CONCEPT:

Definition:
Variable X "Granger-causes" variable Y if past values of X contain information
that helps predict Y beyond what Y's own past values provide.

Key Principles:
‚Ä¢ Predictive causality, not true causality
‚Ä¢ Based on temporal precedence and statistical significance  
‚Ä¢ Bidirectional testing possible (X‚ÜíY and Y‚ÜíX)
‚Ä¢ Requires stationarity of both time series

Mathematical Test:
1. Estimate unrestricted model: Yt = Œ± + Œ£Œ≤i*Yt‚Çãi + Œ£Œ≥j*Xt‚Çãj + Œµt
2. Estimate restricted model: Yt = Œ± + Œ£Œ≤i*Yt‚Çãi + Œµt  
3. F-test: H‚ÇÄ: Œ≥‚ÇÅ = Œ≥‚ÇÇ = ... = Œ≥p = 0
4. Reject H‚ÇÄ ‚Üí X Granger-causes Y

üîç APPLICATIONS IN TIME SERIES FORECASTING:

1. Variable Selection:
   ‚Ä¢ Identify which variables to include in multivariate models
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce dimensionality in large systems
   ‚Ä¢ Focus on statistically significant relationships

2. Lead-Lag Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ Determine optimal lag structure
   ‚Ä¢ Understand timing of relationships
   ‚Ä¢ Identify early warning indicators

3. Policy Analysis:
   ‚Ä¢ Test effectiveness of interventions
   ‚Ä¢ Understand policy transmission mechanisms
   ‚Ä¢ Design optimal intervention timing

4. Risk Management:
   ‚Ä¢ Identify contagion channels between markets
   ‚Ä¢ Early warning systems for financial crises
   ‚Ä¢ Portfolio diversification strategies

üí° PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:

Economic Applications:
‚Ä¢ Oil prices ‚Üí Inflation (typically significant)
‚Ä¢ Interest rates ‚Üí Exchange rates (usually strong)
‚Ä¢ Stock market ‚Üí Consumer confidence (often bidirectional)

Business Applications:
‚Ä¢ Advertising spend ‚Üí Sales (expected positive causality)
‚Ä¢ Competitor pricing ‚Üí Our sales (negative causality)
‚Ä¢ Economic indicators ‚Üí Demand (leading indicators)

Marketing Mix:
‚Ä¢ TV advertising ‚Üí Brand awareness ‚Üí Sales
‚Ä¢ Price promotions ‚Üí Short-term demand spikes
‚Ä¢ Social media sentiment ‚Üí Purchase intention

üî¨ GRANGER CAUSALITY FINDINGS IN RETAIL VAR MODEL:

Typical Results from Retail Company Case Study:

1. Marketing Spend ‚Üí Sales Categories:
   ‚úÖ Electronics: F=4.23, p=0.012 (Significant at 5%)
   ‚úÖ Clothing: F=3.87, p=0.019 (Significant at 5%) 
   ‚ùå Home & Garden: F=1.45, p=0.234 (Not significant)
   
   Interpretation: Marketing effectively drives Electronics and Clothing sales
   but has limited impact on Home & Garden (different customer behavior)

2. Cross-Category Effects:
   ‚úÖ Electronics ‚Üí Clothing: F=2.98, p=0.043 (Weak but significant)
   ‚ùå Clothing ‚Üí Electronics: F=0.87, p=0.511 (Not significant)
   
   Interpretation: Electronics purchases may lead to complementary clothing purchases
   (cross-selling opportunities), but not vice versa

3. External Economic Factors:
   ‚úÖ Consumer Confidence ‚Üí All Categories: Highly significant
   ‚úÖ Price Index ‚Üí Electronics: F=5.67, p=0.003 (Strong effect)
   ‚ùå Price Index ‚Üí Clothing: Not significant (less price sensitive)

4. Bidirectional Relationships:
   ‚úÖ Marketing Spend ‚Üî Sales: Bidirectional causality
   ‚Ä¢ Higher sales ‚Üí Increased marketing budget (reinvestment)
   ‚Ä¢ Higher marketing ‚Üí Increased sales (effectiveness)

üéØ BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:

Strategic Insights:
‚Ä¢ Focus marketing spend on Electronics and Clothing for maximum ROI
‚Ä¢ Use Electronics as gateway products for cross-selling
‚Ä¢ Monitor consumer confidence as leading indicator
‚Ä¢ Price sensitivity varies by category

Operational Benefits:
‚Ä¢ Coordinated inventory planning across categories
‚Ä¢ Optimized marketing budget allocation
‚Ä¢ Dynamic pricing strategies based on cross-elasticities

1. Sales ‚Üí Marketing Spend:
   ‚Ä¢ Do high sales lead to increased marketing budgets?
   
2. Economic Indicators ‚Üí Sales:
   ‚Ä¢ GDP, unemployment, consumer confidence effects
   
3. Competitor Actions ‚Üí Our Sales:
   ‚Ä¢ Price changes, new product launches
   
4. Internal Factors ‚Üí Sales:
   ‚Ä¢ Inventory levels, pricing changes, promotions

üìà RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VAR IMPLEMENTATION:
